# Install the following packages until Arch releases newest Qtile packages dependencies
# Unfortunately packages are flagged out in arch repository, so this is a temporary solution using pip
# Also you need to install wlroots as it's a dependency, you can install it using paru/pacman
# Note: this is temporary, hope one day packages are upgraded in the arch repository

pip install --break-system-packages cairocffi
pip install --break-system-packages xcffib
